# Quizly2

This is an updated version of Quizly from https://github.com/ram8647/quizly created by Ralph Morelli. Ralph's version broke in 2026 due to a Chrome update that did not allow blocks to be dragged in. This new version is updated by Beryl Hoffman and Joe Mazzone and some AI help to use a more current Blockly that doesn't have this problem.

The new version of Blockly in blockly-all.js was built from https://github.com/mit-cml/appinventor-sources/tree/master/appinventor/blocklyeditor.


Quizly is a live coding platform for <a target="_blank" href="http://appinventor.mit.edu">App Inventor</a> that is
based on <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/blockly/">Blockly</a>. For example, 
here we see a quiz where the student has been asked to define a <i>fahrToCels</i> function.
Quizly runs the student's code and reports whether the function is correct or not:

<h2>Demos</h2>

<p>Two separate applications are used for making and taking
quizzes. Quiz Maker generates a JSON object that can be uploaded
(manually, for now) into Quizly:

<li><a target="_blank" href="http://mobile-csp.org/quizly-repo/quizly/">Example Quizzes</a>



<p>The code is free and open source -- and there is much work to do!</p>
